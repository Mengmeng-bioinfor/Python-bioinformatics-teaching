Markdown cells are for formatting text rather than for running code. To see how to format headings, use italics and bold font, for example, you can go into edit mode by double-clicking on a cell. Try it for this cell. To execute the cell (and so produce the formatted text), you can go to *Cell / Run Cells* or use the shortcut *Ctrl-Enter*. (You can find other keyboard shortcuts under the *Help* menu.) Markdown is very useful for mathematical notation such as $\\sqrt{2}$. For further details on Markdown see <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook\" >Markdown in Jupyter Notebook</a>.\n",

However, you should also format the output to 3 decimal places. Hint: one way to do this is to use the `format` function as follows: `print('{:X.Yf}'.format(1.234567))`, where X and Y need to be replaced by suitable integers.
