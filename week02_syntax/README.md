Practical Lab 2
The tasks below aim to challenge your fundamental understanding of program design exploring how to use variables and how to populate and utilise these variables via input and output functions within Python. You may find that you are unable to finish all tasks during the scheduled practical lab session. This is to be expected at this early stage of the module, however, you are strongly encouraged to complete all tasks in your own time over the course of the next two weeks. These labs provide you with the necessary practice to prepare you for future practical lab sessions and will support you to undertake the module Python for Bioinformatics. 
Access the slide deck & recordings provided for Week 2, to support you with these tasks. You may additionally choose to consult the recommended textbook and to seek out the additional web resources, highlighted in Week 1. Please attempt tasks yourself prior to seeking support from one of the Lab Tutors, however, do make sure to seek support if and when you require it. When seeking support, ensure you ask GOOD questions. 
Before starting to complete the formal tasks, please complete the exercises in 
•	Python Syntax
•	Python Comments
•	Python Variables 
•	Python Data Types
•	Python Numbers
•	Python Casting
•	Python Strings
•	Python Booleans
•	Python Operators
(https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp) on your own.
Task 1 – 
- Is 4 / 3 * 2 the same as (4 / 3) * 2 or 4 / (3 * 2)?
Your program should look this when run:
 
Your program should look this when run:
- What is the result of 5 + 8 / 4 - 3 * 6?
 
Task 2 – 
Write a Python code that prompts the user to enter his/her height and assigns the user’s input to a variable named height. Then, output the value stored in the variable, i.e. the user’s entered height. Your program should look this when run: 
 
Task 3 – 
Design a flowchart（https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart）for a program that obtains an item's original price and then outputs the sale price applying a 20% discount. Then write pseudo code for this. 
Implement your pseudo-code as a Python program for the above scenario. Output the sales price to two decimal places. 
Your program should look something like this when run: 
 
Task 4 – 
Write a Python program that work out the volume and perimeter of a box. Assume the user will enter in whole numbers for height, width, and depth. Your program should output the perimeter 4 * (height + width + depth) and volume (height * width * depth) of the box. Your program should like this when run: 
 
Task 5 – 
A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23% of total sales. Write a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, then displays the profit that will be made from that amount (Hint: use the value 0.23 to represent 23%). Your program should look something like this when run: 
 
Task 6 – 
Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the motorway can be calculated with the following formula: Distance = Speed x Time Consider that a car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following: a) The distance the car will travel in 5 hours b) The distance the car will travel in 8 hours c) The distance the car will travel in 12 hours Note that a Constant must be used in this program. Your program should look something like this when run: 
 
Task 7 – 
A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula: MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of fuel used Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of fuel used. The program should calculate the car’s MPG and display the result. Your program should look something like this when run: 
 
Advanced Task 1
Last month, Lily purchased some stock of MultiplAI Health. Here are the details of the purchase:
 • The number of shares that Lily purchased was 1,000. 
• When Lily purchased the stock, he paid £32.87 per share. 
• Lily paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2% of the amount he paid for the stock. 
Two weeks later Lily sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale: 
• The number of shares that Lily sold was 1,000. 
• She sold the stock for £33.92 per share. 
• She paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2% of the amount he received for the stock. 
Write a program that displays the following information (See program design for sample solution, presented below): 
• The amount of money Lily paid for the stock. 
• The amount of commission Lily paid his broker when he bought the stock. 
• The amount that Lily sold the stock for. 
• The amount of commission Lily paid her broker when she sold the stock. 
• Display the amount of money that Lily had left when she sold the stock and paid her broker (both times) and indicate if he made a profit in this venture. 
 
Advanced Task 2
Create a simple Python program that evaluates if a number entered by the user is odd or even and then performs various operations on that number, such as casting, evaluating booleans, and working with strings.
Pseudocode:
1.	Start
2.	Ask the user to enter a number.
3.	Convert the input to an integer.
4.	Check if the number is odd or even:
•	If divisible by 2, it's even.
•	Otherwise, it's odd.
5.	Display whether the number is odd or even.
6.	Perform and display type casting from integer to float and string.
7.	Use boolean logic to check if the number is positive.
8.	Perform and display string operations on the string-casted number.
9.	Use different operators (e.g., +, -, *, /) to perform simple calculations with the number.
10.	Display all results with explanations using comments.
11.	End

The task might use basic Python syntax like if-else.
