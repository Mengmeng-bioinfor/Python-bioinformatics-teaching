You can change the name of the notebook (and the file) by going to *File / Rename* and changing it to *Week_1_Lab_my_version* for example, or by editing the name of the notebook at the top of the page beside the Jupyter symbol (just above the menu).\n",

    "We need to distinguish between different types of cells. This cell is a **Markdown cell**, whereas the next cell below is a **Code cell**. Markdown cells are for formatting text rather than for running code. To see how to format headings, use italics and bold font, for example, you can go into edit mode by double-clicking on a cell. Try it for this cell. To execute the cell (and so produce the formatted text), you can go to *Cell / Run Cells* or use the shortcut *Ctrl-Enter*. (You can find other keyboard shortcuts under the *Help* menu.) Markdown is very useful for mathematical notation such as $\\sqrt{2}$.

    "### 4. Calculate the reverse complement of the DNA sequence using list-related functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing and complementing a DNA sequence involves two distinct steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversing: This is simply taking a DNA sequence and reversing the order of its nucleotides. For example, if you have the sequence \"ATCG\", reversing it would give \"GCTA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Complementing: DNA is composed of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). In the DNA double helix, Adenine always pairs with Thymine, and Cytosine always pairs with Guanine. Complementing a sequence means replacing each nucleotide with its pairing partner. So, for the sequence \"ATCG\", the complement would be \"TAGC\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, reversing and complementing a sequence is often referred to as finding the \"reverse complement\". For the sequence \"ATCG\", the reverse complement would be \"CGAT\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Biology of the Double Helix: DNA exists as a double helix, with one strand running in the 5' to 3' direction and the other running in the 3' to 5' direction. When we talk about a specific DNA sequence in molecular biology, we often refer to the sequence of the 5' to 3' strand. But in various contexts, especially in laboratory experiments and certain analyses, the sequence of the complementary 3' to 5' strand becomes important. Knowing the reverse complement is crucial in these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primer Design in PCR: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental molecular biology technique used to amplify DNA. To initiate the PCR, short DNA sequences known as primers are required. Often, one needs to design a primer that matches the reverse complement of a sequence of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genome Annotation and Analysis: During the process of annotating a genome or analyzing DNA sequences, it's essential to examine both the given DNA strand and its reverse complement to ensure all possible genes (which can be present on either strand) are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA Replication: During DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase synthesizes the new strand in the 5' to 3' direction. This means that while one strand (known as the leading strand) is synthesized continuously, the other (the lagging strand) is synthesized in fragments. Understanding the reverse complement sequence is crucial to understanding this process.\n",
