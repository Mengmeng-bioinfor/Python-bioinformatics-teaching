You can change the name of the notebook (and the file) by going to *File / Rename* and changing it to *Week_1_Lab_my_version* for example, or by editing the name of the notebook at the top of the page beside the Jupyter symbol (just above the menu).\n",

Markdown cells are for formatting text rather than for running code. To see how to format headings, use italics and bold font, for example, you can go into edit mode by double-clicking on a cell. Try it for this cell. To execute the cell (and so produce the formatted text), you can go to *Cell / Run Cells* or use the shortcut *Ctrl-Enter*. (You can find other keyboard shortcuts under the *Help* menu.) Markdown is very useful for mathematical notation such as $\\sqrt{2}$.

    "The t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if they are statistically different from each other. It's particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes and when the variance of two normal distributions is unknown and assumed to be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the t-test and the p-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-test:\n",
    "#### Types of T-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independent samples t-test: Compares means for two groups.\n",
    "2. Paired sample t-test: Compares means from the same group at different times.\n",
    "3. One-sample t-test: Tests the mean of a single group against a known mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence of observations: \n",
    "2. The data points in each group should be independent of each other.\n",
    "3. Normality: The data in each group should be roughly normally distributed.\n",
    "4. Variance: The variance between the two groups should be approximately equal (for an independent t-test).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-value is calculated by taking the difference between the two sample means and dividing it by the standard error of the difference. \n",

    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher absolute value of the t-statistic indicates a greater difference between groups relative to the variability within the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-value:\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the null hypothesis. In simpler terms, it measures how compatible your data is with the null hypothesis (often that there is no effect or no difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used threshold for significance is 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the result is declared statistically significant. This means that if there was no actual difference (the null hypothesis is true), there would be less than a 5% chance of observing a difference as large as the one in your sample due to random chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A low p-value indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis. It suggests that the null hypothesis may not be a good fit for the data and that the alternative hypothesis (that there is an effect or a difference) might be true.\n",
    "Conversely, a high p-value suggests that the observed data is likely under the null hypothesis, and there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis."
